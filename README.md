1. Introduction

This project is meant to be an encompassing project that gives you the full experience of all that you learned in this course. It will bring ideas that we covered as well as had within laboratories. It will also try to reinforce all the skills you learned during your time in laboratory.

We will revisit using something completely di erent but in this setting we will have an idea of what combinational and sequential digital systems are. The project involves something called cellular automata by using the Game of Life invented by John Horton Conway in 1970 [1]. Cellular automata uses discrete, abstract computation systems that are proven useful in numerous complexity models as even more advanced dynamic system over many scienti c elds. This eld is extremely exciting in that it utilizes computation in some form to model repetitive systems to accomplish an outcome. Much of the ideas on cellular automata are intertwined within new ideas on arti cial intelligence and machine learning.

The game works by giving an initial matrix and then the game repeatedly creates multiple matrices after processing the data. Since the game works by itself based on an initial grid matrix, it is sometimes called a zero-player game. The game works by computing a two-dimensional grid of square cells. Currently, the game is only designed for an 8Ã—8 matrix, however, it can easily be expanded to larger sizes. Every cell interacts with its nearest neighbor that is horizontal, vertical, and diagonally adjacent to each cell in the grid (sometimes called a Moore Neighborhood). At each iteration, several rules are utilize based on whether the grid is alive (bit=1) or dead (bit=0). The rules are, as follows [2]:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighborâ€™s lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

To make the matrix easier to use, the grid is only populated with a 1 or a 0 for alive and dead, respectively. The initial pattern for the matrix is called a seed of the system and it determines the patterns that each iteration produces. Each generation is subsequently computed by the rules given and based on the seed interesting outcomes possibly emerge. For more information, please consult the WikiPedia page at the following URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life.

2. Background

The implementation uses a simple register to hold the size of the grid space. For example, the default implementation is given for a 8Ã—8 matrix, as shown in Figure 1, therefore, the register size will be allocated for 64 bits where each bit determines whether a speci c grid is alive or dead. Larger matrices can easily be created by expanding the register size, however, special attention has to be made when accessing a speci c grid point. For example, if a user wants to target (row = 4) and (column = 5) of the matrix, the grid point will be given by: (4âˆ’1)âˆ—8+(5âˆ’1) = 28. Each row and column is subtracted by 1, since the starting grid point at the upper left hand corner is (0,0).

An 8Ã—8 grid looks something like Figure 1 where each grid can contain a 0 or 1 indicating that spot is either dead or alive, respectively. Again, the top left-hand portion of the grid is (0,0). Although 8Ã—8 is rather small, the matrix can easily be expanded, if necessary by examining the datpath Verilog code. A sample Conway game of life is shown at the following URL: http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/.

As stated previously, the matrix is held in a register based on the number of columns and rows. For example, a register in Table 1 is shown for a 4Ã—4 matrix. The key to using the matrix is making sure that a

1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0

Table 1: Sample Register for a 4 x 4 Matrix

new matrix (called an evolving matrix) accesses the register based on several points, as expressed previously.

The initial matrix is called the seed matrix and many interesting patterns can be generated based on di erent seeds. You can search the Internet for some good seeds. I used the following seed to test the design and you are welcome to use the same seed for your testing (given as a Verilog statement) as shown in Figure 2:

The key to digital systems is that digital logic can process data in parallel. To help you with your project, I have coded up the project datapath in Verilog to show how this works. The baseline project involves two simple modi cations to complete the project: adding the control logic and adding logic to display to a screen. In order to complete this project, the following items must be functional on the board:

Control logic should be added to control each iteration of the zero-player game.

A video system in order to handle output to a screen through HDMI.

All testbenches for the system, control, and datapath.

Cleaned up code removing any unnecessary logic and/or states.

A report documenting the complete game and its operation.

Anything you can think of to promote your project!

This project is not di cult and it is an excellent choice for groups that want a straightforward project and/or who wish to spend a minimal amount of time as possible on the project. However, it is in your best interest to make the project better! Any modi cation beyond the baseline project will incur extra points that could help compensate for a bad test, missing homework, or bad quiz. The following are potential modi cations you can easily add for extra credit:

Increase matrix (originally just 8Ã—8)

assign grid = 64â€™h0412_6424_0034_3C28;

Figure 2: Good Starting Seed for Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

Add some cool patterns (e.g., gliders, spaceship check Internet for good starting seeds)

Mutations/Variations on Life (add extra rules â†’ sometimes called better CA)

Make code easier to adapt size (matrix grid)

2-dimensional with color.

Add poster to explain to masses!

Create a YouTubefi channel on this!

3. Implementation

The basic idea for the inputs and output includes your move which you should add through the switches. You will technically only need a Start switch to get things going. The output of the datapath should go to the HDMI section. The controller for the HDMI will be given to you, but you will be required to gure out how to display on it the screen (with help of course).

The main key elements of the design will be provided to you, such as the evolve and rules modules. But, you will have to add registers, control logic (e.g., Finite State Machines), multiplexors, input/output signals. It is advisable to use as many input/output signals to help you debug what is going on as you simulate and get to your nal implementation.

You should use many of the elements discussed in our textbook [3]. I would highly advise using the idioms we discussed in class and in the textbook for things like registers making sure that you also reset or enable them appropriately. That is, you should also incorporate a reset somewhere into your design. All of the HDL discussed in the textbook [3] is on Canvas as a zip le. Feel free to use this HDL in any way you wish.

We are not going to use anything spectacular for the HDMI interface â€“ we are only outputing our matrix. You will need to use the attached SystemVerilog example to help you display things properly on the screen. Your repository will have a sample Vivado project that has the HDMI set up correctly. However, you will need to use this project in the Vivado directory along with the sample code to display the output of your game correctly.

4. Tasks

Most of the main modules have been given to you to help you understand the problem better. In fact, we have given much of the project for you in this text. The di erence here is that we have not given you an testbenches and you will have to gure out how things go together. You have all the skills you need to complete this project, so trusting yourself and the process is worthwhile and I know all of you can do this. The tasks of the project are as follows:

1. Complete block diagrams of your system, include detailed interface speci cations listing all signals anddescribing their timing.

2. Design a control logic presumably with a FSM to have it work correctly.

3. Build the testbench to simulate your design and make sure things are working for both the datapath,control and combined datapath/control.

4. Once your design completely works, implement the design on the DSDB board with the provided HDMIdesign. You should probably use the switches, push buttons, LEDs and also use the seven segment display to output key elements of your project. Remember, to use the LEDs to help you debug your design.

Again, the process here is not di cult. If you need to work out any of the procedures or ask me to inspect your design, I would recommend stopping by to ask questions or advice. I would not advise waiting until the last week to start as I might be busy with end-of-the-semester duties and starting early is the best practice.

4.1 Extra Credit

There are lots of opportunities for extra credit with this project. But, please, rst focus on completing the baseline project before attempting the extra credit option. One of the advantages of digital logic is that many bits can be computed in parallel and then chosen later to be correct or incorrect.

Because Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can contain many millions of logic gates, you could easily expand this game beyond a 8Ã—8 matrix computation. You will have to think about how to distribute this to greater dimensions, but its quite easy if you look at the les that are provided to you.

5. Video and Lab Report

I am asking for both a nal report and video demo of your design. You can easily create a video on your cell phone that is no more than 5-10 minutes that encapsulates your design and how it works. Please work consistently throughout the nal weeks of the semester to make sure you complete the project on time.

I will also give extra credit to those that put a little e ort into making an outstanding video and showcasing their project in detail. You could also potentially discuss other topics including signi cant additions to your project.

You are also required to submit a nal report of your design using the lab rubric. You should remember to submit both your lab report and video report to Canvas for your team, but please also submit your team evaluation, as well. Beware; no late projects will be accepted and if you miss submitting your project on time, you will receive a 0 for your project grade! This procedure should be similar to what you are using for your labs. You should also take a printout of your waveform from your ModelSim simulation. Only one of your team members should upload the les, lab report, and team assessment. Also, please make sure you hand in all les, including your HDL, testbenches, and other important les you wish for us to see.

Please contact Nate Lannan (nate.lannan@okstate.edu) for more help. Your code should be readable and well-documented. In addition, please turn in additional test cases or any other added item that you used. Please also remember to document everything in your Lab Report using the information found in the Grading Rubric.
